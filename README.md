# :beetle: Bugs List:
* Authentication works both ways and is not validated i.e. A Drivers email & password will also work for Customer.
* Paypal Payouts dont work & so have been commented out in code.
* Driver & Customer Login Screens:  App Crashes if no email and password are filled in and the user just clicks on "REGISTRATION".
* If logged in as Customer:  Double tapping "CALL DRIVER" will crash the app.


Made using Android Studio, Firebase, Google Maps API,Google Places APi & PayPal API
